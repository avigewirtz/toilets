        "Overview": "Originally designed as an entry level restroom, the Global has evolved into an extremely cost-effective restroom with a rich assortment of unique benefits. The new impact base has an open grid floor design which allows three times as much fresh air to circulate throughout the restroom. In addition, it comes with a smooth floor cover for those special instances in which the end user requires a smooth floor. A three roll of toilet paper holder and a large door latch that can be operated with the elbow rather than by hand to help prevent the spread of germs. There is also a “hover handle” on the inside of the door for use by those who do not wish to sit directly on the seat. With a lower initial investment operators might believe quality could be an issue. The fact is Global restrooms have a sturdy framework featuring an incredibly strong, one-piece continuous door frame. The latest upgrades also increased the side panel thickness by an additional 12% and the tank and urinal are larger, stronger and easier to clean. While you might think of the Global as an entry level restroom, it easily competes with any restroom for quality and durability."

Along with its beautiful appearance, the Maxim 3000 is also incredibly strong. By utilizing blow-mold technology to create twin-panel walls and a blow molded front, the cabana is almost indestructible. The cabana is also strengthened by interlocking corners, a fitted base and an overlapping roof design. Another clear advantage of the Maxim 3000 is the simplicity of design. It has 40% fewer parts than a typical restroom, which means there is less to break and fewer parts need to be stocked for inventory. Other great features of the Maxim 3000 include deep, well defined corner and roof grips for easy maneuvering, two strong, vandal resistant door springs, a hanging hook and shelf for the convenience of users and a built-in mirror. Overall, the Maxim 3000 requires little maintenance, is spacious and has a very modern, sleek appearance. Together, these features make it the ideal restroom for operators and end-users."

From the ground up the Freedom is stronger, using a custom-made vacuum-formed base to create a solid foundation. In impact tests, the floor and wall joints withstood a force twice as hard as previous designs without damage, and a beveled exterior floor edge improves fork lift access for moving. The reengineered floor has the added benefit of being slightly narrower, for ease of transport, but the overall floor design actually increases the Freedom’s interior space! By widening the front floor area to increase space, it also makes the door opening larger, another added benefit! Other features of interest are the high-impact, plastic lift handles that will not rust and have a wider grip to reduce hand pressure when lifting. Molded-in vent screens were added to reduce maintenance costs, and longer hand rails provide more stability for end-users. The new roof is 50% stronger having added supports, and maintains multiple tie-down options. Finally, a new heavy-duty door closure provides added durability. When you add up all the new benefits and include our industry-leading limited 4-year warranty, the Freedom stands alone in quality and reliability."

        "Overview": "This restroom is built exclusively for the high rise construction market and offers end users and operators a unique set of features. The Highrise has been designed to be semi or fully private. Adding the roof makes it fully private and a sliding mechanism allows it to be lowered far enough to fit through standard door openings. For additional privacy the urinal is placed inside the restroom. Overall, the Highrise has a tremendous amount of interior space and privacy in situations where it was impossible to have before. The Highrise is sized to go where other restrooms cannot. With the optional roof it is only 33.5 inches wide and 78.2 inches high. This allows the Highrise to be moved through halls and doorways to the place where workers need it most. The casters are sealed to prevent freeze up and can be greased for continued reliability. The frame and floor are made from galvanized metal to prevent damage while lifting and handling. This uniquely designed restroom fills the need for privacy, maneuverability and dependability."
